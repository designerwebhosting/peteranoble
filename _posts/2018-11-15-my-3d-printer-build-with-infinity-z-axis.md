It's taken a bit of time, but I am finally working to finish my 3D printer. The printer will have a print area of about 350mm x 350mm (XY) and  infinity for the Z axis.<!--more--> It will print at 45 degrees onto a heated conveyor belt allowing it to build long print in the Z axis. Similar 3D printer geometries have been built by Brook Drumm from Printrbot and Blackbelt.

Over time I will update this post and post new posts about the build and the theory behind this style of 3D printer.
