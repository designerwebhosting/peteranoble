I have updated peteranoble.co.uk to be more accessible, by simplifying the layout and taking an accessibility first approach. Nearly all sites take a mobile first development approach, but this seems to restrict their ability to be accessibile. [WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/ "Accessible Rich Internet Applications") roles have been added and html has been written to work well with text browsers. <!--more-->All [CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/Overview.en.html "Cascading Style Sheets") styling is defined within a stylesheet generated by [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/ "Syntatically Awesome Style Sheets"). I decided not to set classes within html to make the code cleaner.

All content loads and displays without any Javascript styling. I find Javascript is a hurdle for the visually impaired, who may use text reading software or text browsers. The internet has become a visuale experience, but not everybody can take pary in that experience and developers must understand the need to remove barriers to their content.

Please have a look around. Any feedback about the siteâ€™s accessibility would be welcome. Updates will be made as required. Thank you.
